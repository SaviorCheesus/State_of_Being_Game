<h1>Unit 3 Final Project</h1>

<strong>Interaction</strong>: I want to explore how players react when they are allowed to play a game competitively or cooperatively.
Description: This is a game in which two players and one monster enter a dark, dungeon. The monster will only eat one of the players. Each player has a small amount of light. Players can combine their light to increase the radius.
